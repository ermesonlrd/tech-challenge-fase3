{"title": "City of Djinns: A Year in Delhi", "content": "Delhi has a richly layered past, and Dalrymple (In Xanadu, McKay, 1990) deftly peels away each layer to reveal how the city came to be what it is today. Djinns are spirits said to be seen only after prolonged fasting and prayer; they too are integral to understanding the city. The author, a young Scot carrying on the fine British tradition of travel writing, has a knack for meeting fascinating people and capturing their most revealing remarks. He introduces us to dervishes, eunuchs, partridge fighting, weddings, and expatriates. His wife contributes sketches that nicely complement his text.

Never convinced that the condemned women were guilty, Sewall felt remorse; in 1697 he walked into a Boston church and offered a public apology, the only one of the three judges to do so. As a result, he was rebuffed by his social circle. Yet, according to Francis, Sewall's courage is magnified by his taking a stand he knew would result in ostracism.

{"title": "The Contortionist's Handbook", "content": "Clevenger's debut novel is a well-crafted but underplotted character study of a brilliant, damaged man who struggles with mental illness and substance abuse as he bounces in and out of prison and a series of hospitals around Los Angeles. Most of the novel takes place in the latter setting; some tense early scenes pit protagonist John Dolan Vincent against a psychiatrist known as \"The Evaluator,\" who probes Vincent's psyche to see if his recent overdose of muscle relaxants was really a botched attempt to cure his migraine, as Vincent claims, or a suicide attempt. The twist is that Vincent has checked into the hospital under an assumed name; after each of his previous overdoses he has changed his identity to avoid being placed in a mental hospital. The psychiatric interview provides a decent vehicle for telling the story of Vincent's difficult family life and his decision to use his mathematical talent to assist a murky criminal network.

It is suffering from the Roman system, a centralized, hierarchical structure of authority, monarchical in character and imperial in action. Established in the eleventh century by means of a clutch of forgeries (e.g., the Donation of Constantine), that system is, K&#xFC;ng says, primarily responsible for the Orthodox-Roman schism, the Protestant reformation, and the antiscientific and antidemocratic bias in Christianity. Ever entrenching the power of the pope and the Vatican bureaucracy, especially after the 1870 declaration of papal infallibility and again after the second Vatican Council, the system continues to harm the church, driving out believers, lay and clerical, who question it, discouraging vocations to the priesthood, and thwarting ecumenism....", "questions": ["Can you describe the product 'Can We Save the Catholic Church?'?", "What are the main features and advantages of 'Can We Save the Catholic Church?'?"], "responses": ["The product 'Can We Save the Catholic Church?' is written by a German Swiss priest and theologian who portrays the Roman Catholic Church as a gravely ill patient in need of radical therapy to recover and thrive.", "The main features of 'Can We Save the Catholic Church?' include a critique of the Roman system, which includes centralized authority, hierarchical structure, and monarchical character.

Like David Mitchell and Italo Calvino, Thompson has some fun trying out literary styles. One chapter is written as a noir-ish caper, another as a futuristic romance, another follows a serial killer, and there's even a lovely childhood fable with notes of magical realism. The cumulative effect is of a world simultaneously revealed and obscured: just when you've gotten a grip on Communion Town, it's transformed. Thompson's sentences are graceful enough that he mostly pulls off these crafty fireworks&mdash;at least when it comes to miming a style. But too often, exhilarating sentences (like one describing the sea as full of the movements of an anticipatory audience, rustling programs, shushing itself...) are buried in descriptive layers that deaden an entire page.
